# 5209 Interface Analysis and design Assessment 03 part A

## What frameworks did I look into and why?

### I looked into bootstrap, CSS Grids, Foundation, React and Material. The two that I liked the most were Bootstrap and Material. The reason I looked into these frameworks is because I was looking for a framework that is free so there is no initial start up cost. It also had to be open source and have good support with help over the internet. This helps when looking for solutions to problems that may occur. The frameworks also had to have a good range of JavaScript libraries so the functionality is easier to show in the template design stages to see if things are going to work the way I think they are going to. With the libraries I can do this without having to create much JavaScript myself. They are both well established and have been around for 5 - 6 Years so they have run the test of time. They also look like they are going to stay around for the next 5 years because of how popular they are. They are both compatible with most web browsers. They both have mobile capabilities this is important because most people are using their phones on the internet not a laptop or computer. They both support a responsive design and allow the web page to load fast. This will ensure that the user isn't waiting around for the page to load.

## The framework I decide to use for my final design

### I am going to pick bootstrap to do this web application. This is because it has good online tutorials and information so it will be less time consuming to do problem solving. Bootstrap has a large active following so there is a lot of support from 3rd party members. Also it supports a large supply of JavaScript libraries so it will be more productive for me to implement javascript using this. Bootstrap is about six years old so I know that a lot of things have been Tried and I should be able to find the answer to most every question I have. Bootstrap has a toolkit for different screen resolutions devices and screen sizes so it is going to work cross platform and will be able to accompany multiple screen sizes within that device and in different devices. Bootstrap has a good responsive design and will load fast on the initial and extended web search.

### I was really close to wanting to pick material and I think that it could still be a good option. It also has most of the features that bootstrap has. The design looks good and I think in some cases that my design might look more like some of the designs that are in the material templates but the reason I didn’t pick this one is because I couldn't find as much information as I did on bootstrap. I have also learnt and used a bit of bootstrap before and I thought trying to learn something completely new in three weeks might not be the best option.

# Part B

## Learning Difficulty to use framework

### Using the framework bootstrap I found that there is a lot of information over the internet of how to do different things. I found that w3 schools and the bootstrap website itself were the best references on how to implement the different parts. I also found myself looking at stack overflow a lot to try and find out how to do more difficult things that aren't in the bootstrap documentation like how to get the side Nav moving the other way and how to make the map responsive and be at the size I wanted. Stack overflow was a lot of help but I did also find that a lot of the time they will use other plugins like jquery to implement things and when I tried it wouldn’t work. I had this problem when trying to get the sidenav to open from the other side. So overall I enjoyed using bootstrap and I think it is easier to implement things faster using this framework.

## parts I couldn't complete and why?

### On the side menu I Wasn’t able to make the menu come out from right to left on the right side of the page as I have it in the design. I looked up the bootstrap SideNavs and I was only able to find ones that went from the left to the right on the left side of the page. So after looking on there I went and tried to see if I could google if there was a way to do it. In the examples I tried on stack overflow none of them seemed to do what I wanted it to do. There were some examples that included other plugins to help this happen but I couldn't seem to implement it. So I decided to leave the sideNav moving from left to right on the left side of the page. .

### I have changed a little bit of the table to be more of a table so the user is able to see all of the information without it being too crammed. Also I added call and message buttons so people can ring and get to the messages from the family info screen screen to make the flow better.
